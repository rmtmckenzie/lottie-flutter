# LottieFlutter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dnfield/lottie-flutter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fabiomsr/lottie-flutter)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dnfield/lottie-flutter/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/fabiomsr/lottie-flutter)

Lottie-Flutter is based on [Lottie-Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android).

Original effort by [Fabiomsr](https://github.com/fabiomsr).

Lottie is a mobile library that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as json with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) and renders them natively on mobile!

## Current status

Achived rendering parity with lottie-android except for dash paths.

All samples included render.  Motorcycle has some issues still, but also has issues on lottie-android (due to using effects that aren't supported).

## TODO

- [x] DashPathEffect ★ [#9641](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/9641)
- [ ] Add support for effects
- [ ] Improve support for path operation/combinations
- [ ] Support changing colors/timings the way lottie-android does
- [ ] Support scaling larger or smaller than the containing widget?
- [ ] Make more Dart/Flutter like.  In particular, I'd like to split parsing up.
